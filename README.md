# Tokenization into commodity with Python

## Introduction
The asset cannot be broken down into smaller parts with comparable risk for resale owing to regulation in the traditional financial system. Smart contracts in blockchain can tackle this problem by tokenizing financial assets into known commodities. This is the code for our scientific paper. We implemented two tokenization algorithms and applied them to the artificial Forex dataset. The ERC1155-based smart contract is implemented and applied to the algorithms' output to perform sold-out and secondary market steps is [available here](https://github.com/v0landem0rt/ethereum-project).

## Dataset
We collected data from Forex Software  and Bank for International Settlements.
